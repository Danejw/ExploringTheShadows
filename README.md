# ExploringTheShadows

"A virtual reality immersive forest environment called Exploring the Shadows. 

The experience begins with the user spawning at a trailhead, with a trail map outlining three main hiking trails all ending in the same place, called Haven, which is a redwood grove which has the option of being a multi-player location. 

The user then walks down the initial trail and finds themselves at a crossroads with three signs, Trauma Symptoms to the left on the lake path, Trauma Causes to the right for a mountain trail that goes over a waterfall, and Healing Modalities which is the trail directly ahead through the heart of the forest. Each path would have glowing orbs along the edge of the path ways which the user could "click" on to trigger a 3D animation or 360 degree video orb to form around the user, which educates the user on different aspects of trauma and healing. 

At the end of all three pathways, Haven is the final destination, with a grove of redwood trees towering into the sky and sunlight streaming through the trees. We are currently looking to have it be optionally multi-player, to encourage people to connect and share their experiences. Creating safety is also very important, and is a part of the design of the game, on the multi-player level. 

The immersive environment includes soothing sounds and lighting that would signal for safety to support the users on this exploration. Although the space isn't therapeutic in nature directly, it includes relaxing elements and attributes to support emotional and nervous system regulation in users."
